# Plan to Fix Uncommitted Files

Here is a step-by-step plan to address the issues in the uncommitted files.

- [ ] **Analyze and Fix `src/routes/api/ai.ts` and associated type definitions**
    - [ ] **Modify `src/tanstack-start.d.ts`:** Update the `RequestContext` interface. Instead of nesting `env` under a `cloudflare` object, I will define it directly on the `RequestContext` interface to match the implementation in `_worker.ts`. This will fix the `context.env` type error.
    - [ ] **Inspect `src/server/auth.cf.ts`:** Examine the `buildAuthApp` function to understand the structure of the returned `authApp` object and how to correctly access the session API.
    - [ ] **Fix `src/routes/api/ai.ts`:** Correct the `authApp.auth.api.getSession` call to align with the actual API provided by the authentication library, resolving the second linter error.
    - [ ] **Verify `src/routes/api/ai.ts`:** After fixing the types and the auth call, ensure there are no more linter errors in the file.

- [ ] **Review `_worker.ts`**
    - [ ] The current implementation in `_worker.ts` appears correct based on the latest research. No changes are planned for this file.

- [ ] **Review `src/routes/api/interactive-grep.ts`**
    - [ ] Analyze the changes in this file. It doesn't appear to have the same context issues, but I will double-check for any other regressions.

- [ ] **Final Verification**
    - [ ] After applying all fixes, run the linter/type-checker to ensure all issues are resolved.
    - [ ] Stage all the corrected files for commit.
