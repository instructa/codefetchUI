# Cloudflare Auth Adapter Migration

## Overview

We've successfully migrated from the `better-auth-cloudflare` package to our own custom implementation due to schema import errors in the original package. This migration provides us with more control and removes the dependency on a broken third-party package.

## What Changed

### 1. Removed Dependency
- Removed `better-auth-cloudflare` from `package.json`
- No longer dependent on a third-party package that was experiencing issues

### 2. Created Custom Server Adapter
- **File**: `src/server/cloudflare-auth-adapter.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides the `withCloudflare` function that integrates D1 database and KV storage with better-auth
- **Key Features**:
  - Configures Drizzle ORM with D1 database
  - Uses the official `drizzleAdapter` from better-auth
  - Maintains API compatibility with the original package
  - Supports all the same configuration options (though some are currently no-ops)

### 3. Created Client Plugin Stub
- **File**: `src/lib/cloudflare-client-plugin.ts`
- **Purpose**: Provides the `cloudflareClient` function for the client-side
- **Key Features**:
  - Currently a no-op but maintains API compatibility
  - Can be extended in the future for features like Turnstile integration

### 4. Updated Imports
- Changed imports in `src/server/auth.server.ts` from `better-auth-cloudflare` to `./cloudflare-auth-adapter`
- Changed imports in `src/lib/auth-client.ts` from `better-auth-cloudflare/client` to `./cloudflare-client-plugin`

## Implementation Details

### Server Adapter

The server adapter creates a Drizzle ORM instance configured for D1 and passes it to better-auth's official `drizzleAdapter`:

```typescript
// Create a Drizzle instance for D1
const db = drizzle(env.d1.db, {
  schema,
  logger: env.d1.options?.debugLogs,
});

// Use the drizzle adapter from better-auth
authOptions.database = drizzleAdapter(db, {
  provider: 'sqlite', // D1 is SQLite-based
  usePlural: env.d1.options?.usePlural,
});
```

### Client Plugin

The client plugin is a minimal implementation that satisfies the better-auth client plugin interface:

```typescript
export function cloudflareClient() {
  return {
    name: 'cloudflare-client',
    onRequest(init: RequestInit) {
      return init; // No-op for now
    },
  };
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No External Dependencies**: We're no longer dependent on a broken third-party package
2. **Full Control**: We can modify and extend the adapter as needed
3. **Cleaner Integration**: Direct integration with better-auth's official adapters
4. **Future-Proof**: Can easily add features like KV session storage or Turnstile integration

## Notes

- The KV session storage is not currently implemented (better-auth stores sessions in the database by default)
- Geolocation and IP auto-detection flags are accepted but not implemented (these were extras in the original package)
- The implementation focuses on the core functionality needed by the application
