# Worker-Mailer Implementation Summary

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Step 3.1: Add Dependency
- Successfully installed `worker-mailer@1.1.4`

### ✅ Step 3.2: Refactor Email Service
**File Modified:** `src/server/email/index.ts`

Changes made:
1. Added imports for `WorkerMailer` and `CloudflareEnv` type
2. Created module-scoped `workerMailerInstance` for connection memoization
3. Implemented `getMailer()` function for async initialization of WorkerMailer
4. Updated `sendEmail()` to accept optional `env` parameter
5. Added logic to use worker-mailer when `EMAIL_PROVIDER === 'worker-mailer'` and env is provided
6. Falls back to existing providers for local development

### ✅ Step 3.3: Update Authentication Server
**File Modified:** `src/server/auth.server.ts`

Changes made:
1. Updated `sendEmailWithEnv` helper to pass `env` object to `sendEmail`
2. This ensures the Cloudflare environment context is available for SMTP credentials

### ✅ Step 3.4: Configure Environment Variables
**Files Modified:** 
- `alchemy.run.ts` - Added SMTP configuration to secrets
- `.env.example` - Created with all required variables

Added environment variables:
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` - Set to "worker-mailer" for Cloudflare
- `SMTP_HOST` - SMTP server hostname
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port (default 587)
- `SMTP_USER` - SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASS` - SMTP password

## Implementation Details

### Connection Memoization
The implementation uses a singleton pattern to reuse the WorkerMailer connection within a worker instance, which is important for performance in Cloudflare Workers.

### Automatic TLS Detection
The implementation automatically uses secure connection for port 465, following standard SMTP conventions.

### Fallback Support
The system maintains backward compatibility by falling back to existing email providers (console, resend, smtp, mailhog) when:
- Running locally without `env` object
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` is not set to "worker-mailer"

### From Address Handling
The implementation extracts a display name from the email address (using the part before @) or defaults to "No Reply" for better email deliverability.

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Configure Cloudflare Environment Variables:**
   - Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=worker-mailer` in Cloudflare dashboard
   - Add SMTP credentials (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS)
   - Update EMAIL_FROM to your domain

2. **Test Email Flows:**
   - Sign up with email verification
   - Password reset
   - Magic link authentication

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check Cloudflare Worker logs for any connection errors
   - Verify email delivery rates

## Local Development

For local development, the system will continue to use the console provider by default, printing emails to the console. No changes needed to existing local workflows.
