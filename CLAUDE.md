You are an expert in TanStack Start React TypeScript Zustand TanStack Query. You are focusing on producing clear readable code.

# Main Project Rules

- Always get recommendation and best practice considering latest NOW date
- Never use `npx shadcn-ui@latest`! Always use `npx shadcn@latest`.
- Always use pnpm as the package manager.
- All route files must be written in **TypeScript React** (`.tsx`).
- Use alias imports: `~` resolves to root `./src`.
- Don't use default exports in route files.
- If a file might ever ship to the browser, read env vars with import.meta.env; only reach for process.env in code that’s guaranteed to run exclusively on the server.
- Never update .env file, update the .env.example instead
- Never add `import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'` createFileRoute is auto found.

You always use the latest stable versions of TanStack Start 0.0.0‑alpha.89 React 19 Zustand 5 TanStack Query 6 and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

# Project Structure

* Place route files under src/routes using the folder based routing convention of TanStack Start
* Co locate each route component loader and action in the same file to keep feature boundaries clear
* Keep presentational components in src/components and ensure that they are stateless and free of fetch logic
* Place shared hooks in src/hooks and export them with clear names so that they can be tree shaken
* Define global Zustand stores in src/stores and keep one store per bounded context
* Store shared TypeScript types in src/types or colocate them with features when helpful

# Code Style

* Prefer const and readonly arrays or objects to make intent explicit and enable easy refactoring
* Write all route loader functions as async arrow functions that return fully typed objects so that downstream code has exact types
* Use named exports for every module so that imports are explicit and avoid default export confusion
* Derive all data through selectors in Zustand and TanStack Query instead of duplicating state through useState
* Destructure props and hook results at the top of component bodies so that dependencies are clear
* Use useDeferValue or useTransition when updating non blocking UI state to prevent jank

# Usage

* Initialise a single QueryClient in the root layout file and wrap the app with QueryClientProvider so that SSR hydration is automatic
* In each route loader call await queryClient.ensureQueryData to prefill the cache during SSR and avoid extra client round trips
* Prefer useSuspenseQuery and useSuspenseInfiniteQuery so that React can coordinate loading states at the framework level
* Create Zustand stores with create and subscribe using selector functions that include shallow comparison to avoid unnecessary renders
* Use the createFileRoute API to declare routes loaders and components in one file so navigation code stays colocated
* Use the defer helper from TanStack Start to stream partial responses when large data sets would block time to first byte
* Wrap parts of the tree that are strictly client side in HydrationBoundary so that the server markup is not re executed unnecessarily
* Add preload to Link components or use the usePrefetch hook so that data and code are fetched before navigation
* Split code per route with React.lazy and Vite dynamic imports so chunks remain small and cacheable
